# questions for Design: 
  (I would usually request an XD or Sketch file)
  - What are the font sizes for the project? 
  - error handling styles for the input?
  - error verbiage for input if wanting custom?
  - How do you remove a stock from your list? what does that look like
  - what does it look like when there are no stocks selected? 
  - what are the default stocks (pre-adding stocks) - if any.
  - how often should this refresh? (IDK how often stock stuff is updated anyway, this might not be a relevant question if the data remains the same every day)
  - what color is the background? 


# Megan's Project Notes:
 - I would like to optimize the api request. I can't find what function I can call with multiple symbols to get one response, so I'm just looping through, but that's not great long-term of course.
